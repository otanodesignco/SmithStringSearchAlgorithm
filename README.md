SmithStringSearchAlgorithm
==========================

PHP implementation of the smith algorithm

##To-do
* remove the need to create an array of a fixed length.
* use type-def so bad character arrays(boyer-moore & quicksearch) keys are numeric not characters
* fix key offset issue
* remove any C code that doesn't apply to php
